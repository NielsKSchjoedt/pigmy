Pigmy - Probabilistic Graphical Models for ruby

Written by David Salamon <dls@lithp.org>. BSD Licensed.

The goal of this project is to implement with reasonable efficiency,
and high expressiveness, the core pgm opperations for use in A/B
testing, quick-and-dirty command line inference, and other light ML
workloads.

Since there are many exisitng libraries that provide high performance
implementations, and the implementation choice of ruby rather limits
our options in this reguard, this library will likely live and die on
its ease of use.

If you are the sort of person who finds code easier to read than
equations, this library may also prove useful in learning how pgms
function, and in honing your probabilistic intuition
generally. Consider working through "pgm_lecture.rb" in the tests
directory and work out why each test passes.


Feedback and commits eagerly solicited :)

Pigmy - Probabilistic Graphical Models for ruby

Written by David Salamon <dls@lithp.org>. BSD Licensed.

The goal of this project is to implement with reasonable efficiency,
and high expressiveness, the core pgm operations for use in A/B
testing, quick-and-dirty command line inference, and other light ML
workloads.

If you are the sort of person who finds code easier to read than
equations, this library may also prove useful in learning how pgms
function, and in honing your probabilistic intuition
generally. Consider working through "pgm_tutorial.rb" in the test
directory and work out why each test passes.

This library is currently in a state of high flux. No interfaces are
stable, it is only public to to movite my completion and get early
feedback.

Feedback and pull requests solicited :)
